# CulturalCityApp
This app was developed by two students of maste's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Florence, Collini Enrico and Di Martino Andrea.

This project has been assigned as a Security and Knowledge Managements course exam, taught by professor Bellini Pierfrancesco.

Thanks to Km4city's Ontology resources and Google Maps Api, throw this app you can find places of cultural interest in the city of Florence through an interactive application.

## Functionalities
The main functionalities of the application are:
* Near You Search that uses your position to find the cultural points near you.
* Advanced Search that you can use to find cultural points by specifying an address and the desired category.
Note every Cultural Point has a scheda with their information, a button that if pressed reads the description and another button that opens the map with a marker in its location.
* Smart Search that if opened tracks your position and if there is a cultural point in the nearby reads automatically its description
